In this example, the program searches for three rules: r1, r2 and r3.

In r1, we demonstrate how we can analyse a complete if condition.

In r2, we demonstrate that we can analyse while statements.

In r3, we demonstrate another great feature provided by our grammar. In example 3 it was shown how an indentifier could be considered and unknown. In this example, we show that the same mechanism allows the user to search for unknowns on the RIGHT-side of an assignment. For a variable with the identifier 'a' we highlight every attribution that is made to it.
