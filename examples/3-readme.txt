In this example, the program searches for three rules: r1, r2 and r3.

In this pattern, we introduce the main benefit of our own grammar. If '@' is used before a variable identifier, the program will treat that identifier as an unknown. This unknown may accquire any value.

In r1, int @a corresponds to any int variable.

In r2, we demonstrate how the variable type affects the matching.

In r3, we demonstrate how the identifier affects the matching.
